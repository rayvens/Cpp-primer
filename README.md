# This is the repository for my C++ primer bookguide
 I'll be updating it with time.
 
## Main folder:
 Here we have the main project
 Sales_data class and functions

# Person exercise folder
 Side project. A new class made (exercise 7.4)

# Screen-wind folder
Another project (?) in the book, will have screen and window_mgr classes
still unsure if this is important
